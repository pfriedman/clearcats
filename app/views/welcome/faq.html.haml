        What is a service line?
      %dd 
        A method of describing a service that is 
        %em repeatedly offered 
        by a center or program. 
        %br
        Examples might be recurring education offerings, seminars, support programs, trainings, informatics applications, consultations, etc.
    
      %dt
        What is an activity?
      %dd
        Are items that occur during the cycle of a service line. 
        These are items that 
        %em 
          repeat 
        each time you offer the service. 
        %br
        An example would be an education offering (service line) where you would follow-up with many activities, 
        such as an initial meeting with an investigator, a follow-up phone call, a budget development meeting, 
        gather materials for application, assist with a proposal, etc.
        %br
        Activities can also be 
        %em
          onetime events 
        that fall under a service line. 
        %br
        Examples would be things you spend time on that may or may not be specific to a single investigator and follow a systematic progression. 
        An informatics example is the development of an application specific to the needs of one investigator that would not be used by others, 
        but fall under a general service line of informatics development.
