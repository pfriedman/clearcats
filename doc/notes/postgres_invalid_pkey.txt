SELECT MAX(id) FROM entities;


SELECT nextval('entities_id_seq');

This should be higher than the last result.

Is it  the same or lower? If so... did you do some importing or
restoring? (your sequence might be off)

If it's not higher... run this to try and fix it. (run a quick
pg_dump first...)

SELECT setval('entities_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM entities)+1);
